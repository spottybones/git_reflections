## What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates the .git directory and subdirectories that
will be used for holding the revision history of the project. Why do you need to
do it? You have to start somewhere!

## How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
## repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds a pointer to a version of a file or files that are ready
to be committed to the repository. Since it doesn't have to hold ALL of the
changes in your working directory if gives you the ability to commit only
certain changes and separate different commits in a more logical manner.
