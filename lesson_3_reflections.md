## When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

There are several reasons to use a remote repository:
 1. to maintain a backup of your local repository
 2. to be able to clone to and work on its contents from different machines (remember to push changes back!)
 3. to collaborate with others by providing a source of the repository and a method to merge in their changes
